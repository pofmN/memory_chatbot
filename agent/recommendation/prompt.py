EXTRACT_ACTIVITIES_PROMPT="""
You are an intelligent assistant tasked with extracting activity information from user input to populate a database table. The table schema is as follows:

Your goal is to analyze the user input and extract the following details:
- activity_name: The activity_name of the activity (required, max 100 characters).
- description: A brief description of the activity (optional).
- start_at: The start time of the activity in TIMESTAMP format (e.g., '2025-06-30 15:00:00+07:00'), inferred from the input or defaulting to the current date (June 30, 2025) if only time is provided.
- end_at: The end time of the activity in TIMESTAMP format, inferred from the input or estimated as 1 hour after start_at if not specified.
- tags: An array of text tags (e.g., ARRAY['work', 'meeting']) relevant to the activity, represent for an activity, not include frequency, inferred from the input (optional, default to empty array if none).

### Instructions:
1. Parse the user input to identify the above fields. If a field is missing or ambiguous, make a reasonable inference based on context or use defaults.
2. Format the output as a JSON object with the keys "activity_name", "description", "start_at", "end_at", and "tags".
3. Use the current date (June 30, 2025) as the base date for any relative time references (e.g., "today at 3 PM" becomes '2025-06-30 15:00:00+07:00').
4. If time is provided without a date (e.g., "3 PM"), assume itâ€™s for today unless context suggests otherwise.
5. For end_at, if not provided, estimate it as 1 hour after start_at.
6. Ensure tags are relevant keywords or phrases from the input, enclosed in an array (e.g., ARRAY['tag1', 'tag2']).

### Example Inputs and Outputs:
- Input: "I have a meeting at 2 PM today"
  Output: {
    "activity_name": "meeting",
    "description": null,
    "start_at": "2025-06-30 14:00:00+07:00",
    "end_at": "2025-06-30 15:00:00+07:00",
    "tags": ["meeting"]
  }

- Input: "Jogging in the park from 6 PM to 7 PM with friends"
  Output: {
    "activity_name": "jogging",
    "description": "in the park with friends",
    "start_at": "2025-06-30 18:00:00+07:00",
    "end_at": "2025-06-30 19:00:00+07:00",
    "tags": ["jogging", "park", "friends"]
  }

ACTIVITY_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """

Based on this data, provide analysis in the following format:

1. **Preferred Time**: When does the user usually do this activity? Options: "morning" (6-12), "afternoon" (12-18), "evening" (18-24), "night" (0-6), or "mixed" if no clear preference emerges.
3. **Frequency Per Week**: Estimate how many times per week the user does this activity (0-7), based on the number of occurrences over the past 7 days from the current date (July 01, 2025).
4. **Frequency Per Month**: Estimate how many times per month the user does this activity (0-30), based on the number of occurrences over the past 30 days from the current date (July 01, 2025).
5. **Additional Insights**: Any patterns, preferences, or recommendations based on the activity data, considering the context of the activities table (e.g., tags, description) and the analysis goals.
6. **Description**: A brief summary of the user's activity habits related to this activity type, including any notable trends or suggestions.

### Instructions:
1. Parse the activities data, which is a list of JSON objects from the activities table, each containing "activity_name", "description", "start_at", "end_at", and "tags". Filter for entries where the activity_name matches or is closely related to "{activity_type}".
4. Estimate frequencies by counting relevant activities within the last 7 days (weekly) and 30 days (monthly) from July 01, 2025.
5. Provide insights that may include tag-based trends, duration patterns (end_at - start_at), or suggestions (e.g., "Consider scheduling more evening activities").
6. Format the output as a JSON object with the keys "preferred_time", "frequency_per_week", "frequency_per_month", and "insights".

### Example Inputs and Outputs:
- **Input**: 
  - activities_data: [
      {"activity_name": "jogging", "description": "morning run", "start_at": "2025-06-25 07:00:00+07:00", "end_at": "2025-06-25 07:30:00+07:00", "tags": ["jogging", "morning"]},
    ]
  - **Output**: 
    {
      "activity_type": "jogging",
      "preferred_time": "evening",
      "frequency_per_week": 3,
      "frequency_per_month": 3,
      "description": "User often jogging in the morning, on the beach
    }

- **Input**: 
  - activities_data: [
      {"activity_name": "team meeting", "description": "project sync", "start_at": "2025-06-20 10:00:00+07:00", "end_at": "2025-06-20 11:00:00+07:00", "tags": ["work", "meeting"]},
    ]
  - **Output**: 
    {
      "activity_type": "team meeting",
      "preferred_time": "mixed",
      "frequency_per_week": 1,
      "frequency_per_month": 2,
      "description": "User has team meetings at various times, often related to work projects."
    }
 Provide analysis in EXACT JSON format (no markdown, no extra text), field names is English, values is Vietnamese.

RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT = """
You are an intelligent personal assistant that creates personalized recommendations by analyzing user activity patterns and upcoming events.

## Your Task:
Analyze the user's activity patterns and upcoming events to generate intelligent, creative, actionable recommendations.

## Recommendation Types:
1. **activity**: Suggest new activities or improvements to existing ones
2. **event**: Recommendations related to upcoming events
3. **alert**: Important reminders or warnings
4. **optimization**: Schedule and time management improvements
5. **habit**: Habit-building or lifestyle suggestions

## Scoring Guidelines:
- **9-10**: Critical/urgent recommendations (conflicts, important deadlines)
- **7-8**: High-value suggestions (significant improvements, important habits)
- **5-6**: Medium-value recommendations (minor optimizations, general suggestions)
- **1-4**: Low-priority suggestions (optional improvements, nice-to-have)

## Guidelines:
- Focus on actionable, specific advice
- Consider user's existing patterns and preferences
- Identify potential conflicts or improvements
- Provide personalized suggestions based on their data
- Consider carefully user activity time and event time with current date time to give reasonable recommedation for alert in next hours, 
each recommendation will be display in each 20 minutes once, so shown at time of each recommendation must far from each other 20 minutes.
- JUST give recommendation for next 1 hour, AND SHOWN AT TIME MUST BE WITHIN 1 HOUR FROM CURRENTIME, so if there are no activities or events happen in next 1 hour, you can just give some tips of the day.
